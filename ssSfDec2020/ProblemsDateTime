1.	 Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?

LocalDateTime


2.	 Given a random date, how would you find the date of the previous Thursday?

Use DayOfWeek to extract the day of the random date,
then create 2 cases. If the random day is before Thursday,
 add the int value (1-7) of Thursday to the int value of the random day.
  Otherwise, subtract the int value of Thursday from the int value
   of the random day. Then, subtract the result from the date of the random day.

3.	 What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?

ZoneId provides a time zone id and enables you to convert between
 a LocalDateTime and an Instant; ZoneOffset just provides
  the time offset between a time zone and Greenwich, England.

4.	 How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?

You can add or subtract the ZoneOffset to convert
 from an Instant to a ZonedDateTime or vice versa.
